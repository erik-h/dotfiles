### Packages
- [ ] Add a list of ppas so that packages that require them (for now: the ones
  I've commented out in `./PACKAGES/base-ubuntu-packages.txt`) can be
  installed.

### Misc
- [ ] Add `st`'s config.h
- [ ] Add mopidy's configs in ~/.config/mopidy
- [ ] Add ncmpcpp's configs in ~/.ncmpcpp
